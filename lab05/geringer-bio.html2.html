<h1>Mateo Geringer's Biography</h1>

<p>
  I was born on October 14th 2004 in Guatamala. I'm adopted though and have lived in
 <strong>Ipswich Massachusetts</strong>, whcih is just north of boston for all my life.
</p>
<p>
  I am an economics major with hopes of becoming a commercial lender or a financial 
  analyzer. My first job was a lifeguard at a yacht club. I have certifications in 
  BLS for aquatics and other certifications relating to lifeguard training. Currently 
  I work with a company called ISS where I mentor and assist people with disablities. 
  My goals vary depending on the participant, but overall I try to help them develop 
  independance and work on becoming self sufficient.
